## Word counter exercise

Given a text file, output the top N most common words, alonside their line appearance and the number of
appearances of such words.

There is a unit test in `wordcount/tests/test_counter` which puts the function `most_frequent_words`
under test. Your job is to implement the function `most_frequest_words` located in `wordcount/counter.py`

### Setup

1. Run `poetry install` to setup the virtual environment for this exercise
2. `poetry run pytest` to run the test and see how it fares.
